Usage:
  Define a hotkey to call FastGrep() function to search for a string in your project like this:

  map <F12> :call FastGrep()<CR>

  The search result will come back in a window that can be customized to be vertical or horizontal
  using this flag:

  let g:fgVertSplit = 1

  If is defined, the result window will be vertical, horizontal if not.

  In the result window can use 'e' and 'r' keys to cycle between results lines and 'q' to close the window.
  If put the cursor over the filename in the result window, can use gF to go to the file and line number.

  This script used some code burrowed from Specky! [1] and a TextMate bundle [2]

  Happy coding !
